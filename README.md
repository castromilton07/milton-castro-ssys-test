## Project context

This project consists of a technical challenge/test for a developer position at SYSS, and consists of the development of a CRUD API to manage employee information and generate reports based on the youngest and oldest employees and the average age between them, and also based on the lowest and highest salaries and the average salary. As a bonus, a docker compose must be created to raise the application in the development environment and deploy it to a VM instance (AWS, Azure, GCP, Heroku, among other possibilities).

API information must be persistent in a database, and there must be authentication for using the routes.

This technical challenge will have as evaluation criteria:
- Ability to learn with a new task;
- Quality of the source code delivered: it must be simple and easy to understand;
- The logic implemented: the source must solve the problem correctly;
- The interpretation of the task specification is part of the assessment.

The application can be developed in any programming language and the interpretation of requirements and choices of methods and tools is up to the candidate.
